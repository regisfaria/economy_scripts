# Economy Scripts

## Overview

I'm studying a lot of economy lately, and I usually write some scripts to help me doing stuff.

This repository will be a compilation of different scripts that I'm using and is helpful to me(and hopefully can be for you too)

## Scripts

### savings.py

This script takes your liquid salary as input, then asks you for information about how you want to budge you total income. You will split into categories, and assigning it's respective amount of %.

In the end the script will output how much money you can spend at each category, based on your inputs.

#### Requirements & Running

You will need _python 3_.

To run the script, simply:

```shell
> python3 savings.py
```

And then you will be ask for some inputs.
